## Project Structure

In this project you will find everything we use to build a starter pack that will assist you to run a bot on your local machine. which comprises of the following:

1. **Sproutopia** - This base project contains the following files:
    * **SproutopiaEngine** - The engine enforces the game's rules by applying the bot commands to the game state if they are valid.
2. **Runner** - The runner runs matches between players, calling the appropriate commands as given by the bots and handing them to the engine to execute.
3. **Logger** - The logger captures all changes to game state, as well as any exceptions, and writes them to a log file at the end of the game.
4. **StarterBots - Coming Soon** - Starter bots with limited logic that can be used as a starting point for your bot. This folder also contains a bot called `ReferenceBot`, which you can use to test your bot against!

This project can be used to get a better understanding of the rules and to help debug your bot.

Improvements and enhancements will be made to the game engine code over time.

The game engine is available to the community for peer review and bug fixes.
